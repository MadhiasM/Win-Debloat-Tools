## üîÑÔ∏è Roll-Back

**If something breaks you can rely on:**

1. If you want (almost) everything to it's original state, use the `Undo Tweaks` button on [`Win10ScriptGUI.ps1`](./Win10ScriptGUI.ps1).
2. A restoration point done by the script itself;
3. The `Repair Windows` button on [`Win10ScriptGUI.ps1`](./Win10ScriptGUI.ps1);

## ‚ùó Usage Requirements

The `Win10Script(CLI/GUI).ps1` does not make everything automatically, so follow these steps.

- Extract the `.zip` file to another folder.
- Run `OpenTerminalHere.cmd` (try as admin if nothing happens at all).
- Enable execution of PowerShell scripts and Unblock PowerShell scripts and modules within this directory (Down below).

### **GUI Version**

- Copy and Paste this entire line below on **PowerShell**:

```ps1
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser -Force; ls -Recurse *.ps*1 | Unblock-File; .\"Win10ScriptGUI.ps1"
```

![Script GUI](./src/assets/script-gui.gif)

_The `Apply Tweaks` button is the main one for debloating._

### **CLI Version** (Minimal, good for automation)

- Copy and Paste this entire line below on **PowerShell**:

```ps1
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser -Force; ls -Recurse *.ps*1 | Unblock-File; .\"Win10ScriptCLI.ps1"
```

**[Scripts](./src/scripts) can be run individually, pick what you need.**
